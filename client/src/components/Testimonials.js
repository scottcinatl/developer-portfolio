                "I had the pleasure of mentoring Scott during his one month internship at Zapic. I am impressed by
                Scott's speed in becoming a confident JavaScript developer. Throughout the internship, Scott clearly
                demonstrated his ability to collaborate on user experience and user interface designs, implement ReactJS
                components and RxJS streams, and communicate unique perspectives in group discussions. Scott is eager to
                learn new tools and techniques and quick to incorporate them in daily activities. Scott will be a great
                asset on any development team."
